The three SQL queries have the following differences:

1. The first query is selecting a list of fields from three tables where it meets certain conditions. This query seems to be pulling detailed sales data.
2. The second query is very similar to the first one, but with an added condition excluding certain brand names ('DG', 'LM', 'ES') from the results. This means that it's pulling similar sales data, but excluding sales of items from these three brands.
3. The third query differs significantly from the first two. It is an aggregate query that calculates the total quantity and value of items sold, grouped by several factors such as month, year, country, item code, item name, currency, category, subcategory, retail group, and brand name. This query is likely used to generate reports or summaries of sales data.

    T1.[U_ItemName],
    SUM(T1.[U_Qty]) AS Total_Qty,
    T1.[U_Currency],
    SUM(T1.[U_ValueUSD]) AS Total_ValueUSD,

    T0.[U_Type] = 'O' AND 
    T1.[U_Qty] <> 0 AND 
    T1.[U_ValueUSD] <> 0 AND 
    T1.[U_Date] >= DATEADD(MONTH, -7, CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)) AND 
    T1.[U_Date] <= CONVERT(VARCHAR(8), GETDATE(), 112) AND 
    T3.[U_BrandName] NOT IN ('DG', 'LM', 'ES') AND
    T2.[U_Country] = 'SA'
GROUP BY
    T1.[U_Month],
    T1.[U_Year],
    T1.[U_Country],
    T1.[U_BarCode],
    T1.[U_ItemName],
    T1.[U_Currency],
    T2.[U_Category],

```

This query is similar to the third query but with two additional conditions in the WHERE clause:

1. The date range is changed to select records where the date is within the last 7 months from the current date. This is done using the DATEADD function to subtract 7 months from the current date.
2. The country is now explicitly set to 'SA', so the results will only include sales data from this specific country.
